## How I got the idea for this app:

For the past year or so, I have been on a self-learning journey, during which I've gained insights into various aspects of both my personal and professional life. Throughout this time, I've engaged in conversations with some of my friends who have also embarked on similar journeys, albeit on different topics or subjects. I found it fascinating to exchange thoughts and ideas with them, even when the topic wasn't necessarily my primary interest. It was through these interactions that I got the idea for this app. I believe it has the potential to foster a community of individuals who are passionate about personal and professional growth.

## Features:

* **Feed**: Explore a feed filled with discoveries of other users
* **Personalized Experience**: Tailor your feed based on users and topics you follow
